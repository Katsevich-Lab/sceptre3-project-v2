I'm working on a project, whose goal is to scale the sceptre software to large datasets using Nextflow. I have a prototype of the sceptre Nextflow pipeline. My immediate goal is to use this pipeline to analyze the Replogle rd7 dataset. I will be working across several directories in this project:

~/code/sceptre-pipeline: sceptre Nextflow pipeline
~/code/sceptre: sceptre R package
~/code/crispat_analysis: work by others where sceptre was successfully used to analyze Replogle data
~/data/external/replogle-2022: replogle data
~/data/projects/sceptre3: preliminary results for this project; /nf_pipelines/rd7_trans contains preliminary results on the replogle dataset
~/data/external/braunger-2024: results from the crispat papers
